							<!-- Background on how this game fits into my overall game development journey. -->
							<h3>Background info</h3>
							<p>Bardcore Rock was the product of a robotics module during university, it is comprised of two custom game controllers and a Unity game. I found this module really fun due to a fair bit of experience in robotics before attending university. I've always found robotics interesting and this module helped to show how it can be used within the context of game development. If there were more oppertunities for robotics in game development I would most likely have completed more projects in this area because of how much I enjoy working with electronics however as the industry stands at the moment there isn't a lot of work that joins robotics and game development.</p>
							<!-- What the game actually is. -->
							<h3>About the game</h3>
							<p>Bardcore Rock is a infinite scroller game where the player traverses a dungeon moving side-to-side using the Dance Pad game controller to avoid the spikes on the floor. The player also has to fend of monster found while exploring by using the Keytar game controller to cast the corresponding colour spell to the monster in front of them. The game also features a distance counter in the top left of the screen to show how far along the dungeon they are, and to keep score between runs. The longer the player survives, the faster the player moves along, making it more difficult as they travel deeper into the dungeon.</p>
							<!-- What skills/techniques did I cultivate and gain from this project. -->
							<h3>Skills Gained</h3>
							<p>While I had a decent amount of experience working with electronics, combining electronics and Unity was a new challenge. Instead of creating these game controllers from scratch, we were encouraged to re-use old electronics and turn them into our custom controllers, so Bardcore Rock, I used an old kids piano and Dance Dance Revolution game pad. I first had to take them apart to see how they worked, then removed some parts and added my own parts to get them to communicate to the two arduinos I used. From there, they then communicated to Unity through the serial busses and a plugin for Unity that allowed communication that way.</p>
