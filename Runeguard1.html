							<!-- Background on how this game fits into my overall game development journey. -->
							<h3>Background info</h3>
							<p>Runeguard was my first attempt at game development, I started it in 2021 when I was still trying to decide what area of computer science I wanted to go into. I'd been programming for several years by this point, but I had also started to work on more creative projects in other areas of my life. I had began to realise that I enjoyed working more creatively and wanted to somehow combine that with my programming skills. I'd been gaming for years and creating my own game always felt like one of those unnatainable goals, but 2021 gave me the oppertunity to try with a project I needed to design and create for part of my A-Level in computer science.</p>
							<!-- What the game actually is. -->
							<h3>About the game</h3>
							<p>The game itself is more so a prototype of an interesting 'combined stamina turn based' mechanic where the player can walk around freely exploring the top-down pixel art world with a fog-of-war lighting system that hid enemies and objects that were behind corners. Then when the player encounters an enemy, they would be put into the combat state where as they moved their stamina bar would slowly drain, and using their attacks would also drain the stamina bar by a fixed amount. The idea of a stamina bar is nothing new, but having the player watch it run down as they walk around and having the walking stamina combined with the action stamina is something not seen as often in turn based games.</p>
							<!-- What skills/techniques did I cultivate and gain from this project. -->
							<h3>Skills Gained</h3>
							<p>As this was my first project in the area of game development, I didn't really go into it with a set list of skills I wanted to improve. That being said, however unintentional it may have been, I tought myself (with the help of various youtube videos) the basics of my first game engine, Godot. Along with learning how game engines work, this project also helped me learn how to integrate art assets into projects. I purchased a small pixel art pack from Itch and learnt what a sprite sheet was and how to add them into the engine and animate them, along with environment tile sets and how tilemapping works for 2D games. I was also introduced to the basics of games programming with techniques such as state machines, custom character controllers, and referencing other classes/game objects throughout the game, etc.</p>
