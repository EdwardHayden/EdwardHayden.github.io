							<!-- Background on how this game fits into my overall game development journey. -->
							<h3>Background info</h3>
							<p>Ribbit Romance was created in the first game jam I participated in, the 2024 Global Game Jam. I organised a group to take part a few weeks prior to the start, made up of five artists, three programmers, and a writer. While technically the Global Game Jam runs for a full week, we participated in a shortened version of it where we just had the weekend and as such, this entire project was completed in under 48 hours. This is the first project where I officially took on the role of designer and put together our Game Design Document that we used throughout development. I also took on the responsibilty of organising what work was most improtant on our Trello board, and kept track of what work was currently being worked on and checking it met the requirements for the project.</p>
							<!-- What the game actually is. -->
							<h3>About the game</h3>
							<p>Ribbit Romance: Vol VII is a 2.5D, sidescrolling, platformer where you play as a prince who, due to an unfortunate interaction with a witch, got himself turned into a frog, and must hop through each level of the witches tower searching for true loves kiss. Each level of the tower is patrolled by the witches rat henchmen, and through the door at the end of each level is a character the player must romance via trading gems obtained from the henchmen to be allowed passage higher up the tower.</p>
							<!-- What skills/techniques did I cultivate and gain from this project. -->
							<h3>Skills Gained</h3>
							<p>For this project, I focused less on programming, and more on other aspects of game development to help me be more T-shaped in my development skills. I took on the role of designer for our game and created the Game Design Document that our team worked off for the 48 hours. I also dedicated a lot of my time during this project to organising the teams agile workflow, keeping track of tasks, and ensuring everything made fit the criteria laid out in the task brief. That being said, towards the end of the deadline, I spent a lot of time programming and bug fixing along with the other programmers on the team to try to get our product in a working state for the game jam.</p>
