							<!-- Background on how this game fits into my overall game development journey. -->
							<h3>Background info</h3>
							<p>Umbral Crypt was the final product of a game jam I participated in over summer with two other programmers. We wanted to work on being more T-shaped as developers so we made did all the art, design and programming ourselves along with some of the audio. The game jam we participated in was the 2024 Pirate Software Game Jam which ran for two weeks with the theme of "Shadow and Alchemy".</p>
							<!-- What the game actually is. -->
							<h3>About the game</h3>
							<p>We spent the first couple days of the jam ideating and prototyping different ideas for our game but eventually settled on an exploration horror game where the player is an alchemist trying to find shards of a tablet to gain entry to the room holding the Philosophers Stone all while evading a shadown monster. The game's main feature is a free drawing mechanic where they can draw with different colour chalk on the surrounding environment. If the player draws the correct sequence of shapes to match a rune, the connected magical effect happens such as locking or unlocking a door or stunning the monster when it walkes over the rune.</p>
							<!-- What skills/techniques did I cultivate and gain from this project. -->
							<h3>Skills Gained</h3>
							<p>I focused my energy in three main areas for this game. First I wrote up our Game Design Document as it was a requirement for this jam. Second was helping work on the 3D modelling. I have some prior experience working in Blender before attending university and so took this project as a good time to brush up on those skills and further develop them. All of the 3D art for this game was done in Blender by myself and another programmer learning the software. The last thing I focused on for this project was the main mechanic of drawing in 3D space and then detecting what was drawn. For that mechanic, we spent a while researching and eventually found <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/uist-07.01.pdf">an academic paper that detailed a shape detection algorithm</a> that we liked the look of. So I spent a large portion of the jam first getting the drawing in 3D spaces working and then going through the paper and implementing what it talked about for our game.</p>
