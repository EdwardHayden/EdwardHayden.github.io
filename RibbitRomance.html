							<!-- Background on how this game fits into my overall game development journey. -->
							<h3>Background info</h3>
							<p>Ribbit Romance was created in the first game jam I participated in. It was made as part of the 2024 Global Game Jam, I organised a group to take part a few weeks prior to the start made up of five artists, three programmers, and a writer. While technically the Global Game Jam runs for a full week, we participated in a shortened version of it where we just had the weekend and as such, this entire project was completed in under 48 hours. This is the first project where I officially took on the role of designer</p>
							<!-- What the game actually is. -->
							<h3>About the game</h3>
							<p>The game itself is more so a prototype of an interesting 'combined stamina turn based' mechanic where the player can walk around freely exploring the top-down pixel art world with a fog-of-war lighting system that hid enemies and objects that were behind corners. Then when the player encounters an enemy, they would be put into the combat state where as they moved their stamina bar would slowly drain, and using their attacks would also drain the stamina bar by a fixed amount. The idea of a stamina bar is nothing new, but having the player watch it run down as they walk around and having the walking stamina combined with the action stamina is something not seen as often in turn based games.</p>
							<!-- What skills/techniques did I cultivate and gain from this project. -->
							<h3>Skills Gained</h3>
							<p>As this was my first project in the area of game development, I didn't really go into it with a set list of skills I wanted to improve. That being said, however unintentional it may have been, I tought myself (with the help of various youtube videos) the basics of my first game engine, Godot. Along with learning how game engines work, this project also helped me learn how to integrate art assets into projects. I purchased a small pixel art pack from Itch and learnt what a sprite sheet was and how to add them into the engine and animate them, along with environment tile sets and how tilemapping works for 2D games. I was also introduced to the basics of games programming with techniques such as state machines, custom character controllers, and referencing other classes/game objects throughout the game, etc.</p>
